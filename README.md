RC2014 CPM Disk Explorer

This is a disk image(container) browser/editor/writer for the RC2014.
Disk images for the CP/M system can be read/altered and written again to a Compact Flash card.

I found it to be better to work with 256MB CF cards.
The 128MB cards I had where from china and in fact less then 128MB so it booted ok but produced problems accessing the files on the RC2014.
