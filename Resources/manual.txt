<Introduction>

This is a disk image(container) browser/editor/writer for the RC2014. 

<Operations>

Open an image file (.CPM) or container file (.IMG) from the menu or the toolstrip button.
On the left the drive is displayed on which this image will be mounted, on the right all files in this image will be displayed. 

If it is the first image a question will be asked if this image contains a boot 'sector', if answered with Yes the first 16K bytes from this image will be treated as a boot region.
You can see the content of the boot region with the button 'BOOT' at the top of the screen.

Remember to set the right amount of directory entries on the right, usually 512 but I also came across images with 2048 entries.

You can also create a new image file with 'File->New'. 

Inserting file(s) into an image with 'File->Insert'.
Multiple files can be selected in de dialog screen.
If the image in which you insert a file is 'A' and the file is a binary (.bin) or an Intel Hex (.hex) this will be treated as an insert for the boot sector (the hex will be converted to bin).
Additional entries for the boot sector can be made, they will be put after the last entry (if free space allows).

Deleting files from an image can be accomplished with pressing the 'Delete' button.
The current selected file (in the right window) in this image will be deleted.

Closing an (image) file can be done with 'File->Close'.
Remember drive 'P' if you have this, this is a 2MB drive that will now be drive 'O'.
If you add another drive now there will be problems ;-)
 
You can save the current image file with 'File->Save'.

You can extract and save all files in an image with 'File->Save Files'.
They will be put in a seperate folder.
Remember that if you have 2 files with the same name/type in an image, the files will be overwritten.

You can save the current container with 'File->Save Container'.
An external tool can then be used to write this container to a Compact Flash Device.

You can read an (image)container direct from a CF card with 'File->Read RAW image from CF'.

You can also save the (image)container direct with 'File->Save RAW image to CF'.
CAREFULL: WITH THIS COMMAND YOU OVERWRITE ALL DATA ON THE SELECTED REMOTE DRIVE (COMPACT FLASH, USB DRIVE, REMOTE HARDDISK ETC.)
